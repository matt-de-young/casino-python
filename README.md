# casino-python
Implements card games for fun and not profit!

This is a fun little project with no real purpose other than to provide some example code for my Github & to stay sharp on my skills. This also serves to lay out the business logic & state machine for a another project in the future. Eventually, this project might expand into the same implementation in different languages.
